Windows 8 / Metro Theme for phpMyAdmin 4 v3.0

In recent times, many requests have been sent for me by users, asking for a version of my Metro theme which is suitable for pma 4.

This is a minimalistic, clean theme for phpMyAdmin 4, inspired by Windows 8 app design.
Tested under Firefox 22, Chrome 27, Safari 5.1.7, Opera 12.12 and Internet Explorer 9 & 10.
Using this theme under any earlier version of browsers listed above may cause erroneous appearance. Such browsers like Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 are definitely not recommended for this theme.

Notes:

1. To use this theme, copy the theme directory under "themes" directory.
2. In layout.inc, schemes can be switched by defining $scheme variable.
3. If Open Sans, Segoe UI and IcoMoon font families are already installed on your system, there's no need for the webfont integration (@font-face) in common.css and fonts directory.
